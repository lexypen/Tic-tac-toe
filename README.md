User Story

Anyone surfing the interwebs can search and open a website for practicing their Tic-Tac-Toe strategy skills by going to the website, tttpractice.com.
When they open the page, boom. The grid is right there, waiting for the user to start.
Looking around the screen, the user notices the page heading with the title of the page: "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe Practice!"
On the left-hand side, they can actually create an account and sign up at TTT Practice by filling in their e-mail, choosing a password, and confirming that password.
They also see that there's a "sign in" option just below the "sign up" fields. The user thinks: So, someone must already have an account with this website? Maybe I should join, too, and see what it is that I'm missing?
The user gets distracted by the grid - there's stuff written just above it. 
"You start as X! Next game you start as O. And so it goes successively. Click New Game and then click on one of the squares to make your first move."
The user notices a large button below the grid. Indeed, it says "New Game" on it. They click it.
They hover their cursor over the grid. Each available square in the grid becomes a lighter shade when the cursor is hovering over it. The user knows the game is on.
They think about their move and click a square. The square shows a brand new X right in the middle of it.
They think about their next move and click on another square. That square reacts by featuring a big O.
At some point, the user forms a line of three incidences of O. Just in like real-life Tic-Tac-Toe, the line is either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. A modal pops up with the message: "O won!"
The same thing happens when X wins. Except, of course, the modal reads: "X won!"
Sometimes, though, no one wins - it's a tie. When all nine squares get filled in, a modal pops up saying: "Tie!"
