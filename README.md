About TTT Pratice

TTT Practice is a website for user who, for whatever reason, take their tic-tac-toe game really seriously. And we all know how like-minded individuals tend to find each other, so the TTT Practice user probably has a friend or two who takes tic-tac-toe just as seriously. When they meet, there are some serious Pok√©mon battle vibes in the air. So, TTT Practice was created so that these two geeks can practice their tic-tac-toe skills on their own, so that when they meet to do tic-tac-toe battle, they're at the top of their game.
